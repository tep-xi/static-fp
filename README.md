# tEp's New Home Page

In order to the improve the reliability, maintainability, and
ease-of-customization of the tEp home page, we're transitioning the
site to be statically generated (using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)) and
hosted on Github Pages. 

[Travis CI](travis.mit.edu) tracks `master` and handles site deploys. 

Please submit PR's to make changes (**don't**  commit directly to
`master`).
