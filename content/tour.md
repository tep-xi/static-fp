You've heard stories about tEp: a.k.a. the purple palace, the last stronghold of the knights of the lambda calculus, the U.S.S. Birthday Ship. You've been meaning to get over there to see what it's all about.

But, you are lazy. Instead, you went to the tEp website and opted for the _virtual_ house tour. We understand.

This site brings you to such a virtual house tour. It is a multimedia text adventure game. But, while you can interact with the tour conventionally using the keyboard, 
__you can also click on the links and the purple map__, which will automatically type the corresponding command for you.

For your tour, we are providing you with Irving Q. Tep, the spirit of the house. He'll be giving you the descriptions and stories you will read during your tour.

Without further ado:
