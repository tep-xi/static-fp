title="Massacre la Bourgeouisie!"
+++

A spectre is haunting tEp -- the spectre of cake. Through revolution and exploitation the Bourgeouisie has amassed cake for itself and reforged feudal caste divisions into a simpler, more sinister antagonism: cake and not cake.  Students of MIT, unite! Together we will overthrow Bourgeouis supremacy and form a more equitable distribution of cake: an association of the proletariat for the free development of cake for all.
